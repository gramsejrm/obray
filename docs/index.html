        The obray PHP framework was developed as a minimalistic approach to building web based applications.  The
        basic tasks the framework is attempting to accomplish are the following:
        <ol>
            <li>Receive URI (universal resource identifier) and translate that into a class and function to be executed by PHP</li>
            <li>Enforce permissions on each of those URIs</li>
            <li>Provide basic access to the database and handle the database connection</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
        Based on the approach above the framework provides a simple groundwork for more complex tasks to be accomplished.
